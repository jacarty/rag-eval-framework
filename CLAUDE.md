# [Project Name] — Claude Code Context

## Project Overview

<!-- One paragraph: what does this project do? -->

**PRD:** `docs/prd/v1.0-prd.md`
**Build Guide:** `docs/build-guides/v1.0-build-guide.md`
**Process:** `docs/process.md` — branch/PR cadence, pre-commit + pre-PR agent gates, trivial-change fast path, phase-boundary rituals. Read this before any feature work.

<!-- If using issue tracking, add details here:
**Issue Tracking:** [Tool] — [project/board name], [team/key]
-->

## Rules

These are non-negotiable. They apply to every session regardless of scope.

- **Never commit directly to main.** Always create a feature or fix branch and open a PR. No exceptions.
- **Before pushing, verify only intended files are staged.** Run `git status` and `git diff --cached --name-only` before every commit. Do not include unrelated config files, lockfile churn, or editor artefacts.
- **Run lint + tests + build locally before opening a PR.** Do not rely on CI to catch issues. The pre-PR gates in `docs/process.md` exist to shift catches earlier, not replace local validation.
- **Read `docs/process.md` before any feature work.** It defines the agent cadence, trivial-change fast path, and fold timing. Follow it.

<!-- Add project-specific rules below as you discover them. Examples:
- Do not introduce [library X] — this codebase uses [library Y] for that purpose.
- Terraform must apply before Amplify builds when env vars change.
- Always use MCP servers (Linear, GitHub) over manual API calls when available.
-->

<!-- TDD mode (activate per-project):
When the build guide or user specifies TDD:
1. Write a failing test that captures the acceptance criteria
2. Implement minimum code to make it pass
3. Run the full test suite and iterate until green
4. Proceed to the next requirement
Do not skip step 1. The test is the specification. -->

<!-- Document your project's directory structure here.
     Keep this updated — the doc-generator agent refreshes it at phase boundaries. -->

---

## Key Patterns

<!-- Document the important architectural patterns, conventions, and contracts
     that someone working on the codebase needs to know. Examples:

- How auth tokens flow through the system
- How errors are structured and propagated
- Shared module/helper contracts
- Naming conventions for files, functions, routes
- Data model patterns (e.g. DynamoDB single-table design, SQL schema conventions)
-->

---

## Testing

| Level | Tool | Scope |
|-------|------|-------|
| Unit | | |
| Integration | | |
| E2E | | |

<!-- Add run commands:
Run tests: `npm test` / `pytest` / etc.
-->

---

## Git Workflow

**Branch strategy:** Feature branches → PR → merge to main.

```
main                    ← production; protected
└── feature/<slug>      ← feature work
└── fix/<slug>          ← bug fixes
```

<!-- Document your branch naming conventions and typical flow -->

---

## Deployment

<!-- How does code get from main to production?
- Infrastructure: terraform apply / CloudFormation / etc.
- Application: auto-deploy on merge / manual deploy / etc.
- CI/CD: which workflows run on PR vs merge
-->

---

## Common Pitfalls & Constraints

<!-- Document the things that have bitten you or will bite someone new.
     These are the hard-won lessons — keep them updated.

Examples:
- Service X has a 30s timeout that affects Y
- Config Z must be set before first deploy
- Region constraint on service W
- Item size limits on data store

## Updating this document

This file is maintained by the **doc-generator** agent at phase boundaries and should reflect the current state of the codebase. If you notice drift between this document and reality, fix it — stale context is worse than no context.
